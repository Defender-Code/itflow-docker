# About this Image
This is the Docker image of [ITFlow](https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow). This image was created by a community member, we don't "officially" support Docker. This image is not ready for production use. 

This image is based on Alpine 3.21

Please see the wiki: https://docs.itflow.org/installation_docker

# Usage
## ITFlow Only (no Reverse Proxy) 
1. Copy [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itflow-org/itflow-docker/main/docker-compose.yml) and [Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itflow-org/itflow-docker/main/Dockerfile) to a directory.
2. Within docker-compose.yml, adjust the ```environment:``` variables such as ITFLOW_NAME, ITFLOW_URL and ITFLOW_REPO (to your own MSPs fork).
3. Copy the [.env](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itflow-org/itflow-docker/main/.env) file to the same directory.
> Enter your timezone, root domain and database password within this file. You can avoid this step entirely by adding the information to your docker-compose.yml file directly instead. Or being safe, by using docker secrets.
4. Run ```docker compose up -d```
5. Go to your domain. You should be redirected to setup.php. Enter server information correlated to your set up .env and docker-compose.yml files.
> Defaults:  Username: itflow, Password: $ITFLOW_DB_PASS from .env, Database: itflow, Server: itflow-db
6. You will either need to setup your reverse proxy from here to login or modify config.php in /var/www/localhost/htdocs if you're not using SSL
> ```$config_https_only = FALSE;```

## Complete [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/quick-start/) Solution (Reverse Proxy)
1. Copy the traefik [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itflow-org/itflow-docker/main/traefik-complete/docker-compose.yml) to a directory.
2. Within docker-compose.yml, adjust the ```environment:``` variables such as ITFLOW_NAME, ITFLOW_URL and ITFLOW_REPO (to your own MSPs fork).
3. Copy the [.env](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itflow-org/itflow-docker/main/traefik-complete/.env) file to the same directory. 
> Enter your docker path (/srv/docker, ., etc), cloudflare info, timezone, root domain and database password within this file.
4. Create your A records for your host. 
5. Run ```docker compose up -d```
6. Verify you are getting certificates through LetsEncrypt. You will have two public URLs, traefik.$ROOT_DOMAIN and $ITFLOW_URL. 
7. Go to your domain. You should be redirected to setup.php. Enter server information correlated to .env and docker-compose.yml
> Defaults:  Username: itflow, Password: $ITFLOW_DB_PASS from .env, Database: itflow, Server: itflow-db
